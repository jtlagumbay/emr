# MediVault: a self-help medical record management system
by Jhoanna Rica Lagumbay, Pinky Grace Marfa, and Ellenmarie Frances Puyot

In Partial Fulfilment of the Course Requirements for CMSC 21 – Fundamentals of Programming 

The present system of the local family clinic is still manually done, where medical information is written and accessed manually by the doctors, nurses and assistants without using the latest technology. Moreover, the patients will have to keep and carry a physical copy of the prescription of their medication given by the doctor. All the records will then be stored in a pile of files for the different patients, where finding and managing the lists may be tedious once a problem occurs.

# Utilizing fundamentals of programming - arrays, pointers, linked lists, file manipulation, polymorphism through MERN
# MERN Stack: MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. 

MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: MongoDB, Express, React and Node. js. It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier.

MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

MongoDB - document database

Express(.js) - Node.js web framework

React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework

Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server

The MERN architecture allows you to easily construct a 3-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database) entirely using JavaScript and JSON.

MERN Use Cases
Like any web stack, you can build whatever you want in MERN - though it’s ideally suited for cases that are JSON-heavy, cloud-native, and that have dynamic web interfaces. A few examples might be: - Workflow management - News aggregation - Todo apps and Calendars - Interactive forums / social products.
And whatever else you can dream up!

Therefore, the group made an electronic medical record (EMR) system to satisfy the project proposal's goals:
MediVault will serve as an electronic medical record to manage medical information. The following are the main objectives of the project:
# - create a system where doctors can store patient’s diagnosis and medication. 
# - build a system where patients can access their own medical history including, medical diagnosis, medication, and doctor.

Happy hacking!
